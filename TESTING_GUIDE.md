# Testing the Dynamic Blog System

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Start Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
npm run dev
```

### 2. Create Your First Blog Post
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/admin`
2. Login with:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Fill out the blog form:
   - **Title**: "Welcome to Our Blog"
   - **Author**: "Admin"
   - **Content**: "This is our first blog post! We're excited to share food tips, restaurant reviews, and cooking guides with you."
4. Click "Create Blog"

### 3. View on Homepage
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Scroll down to the "From Our Blog" section
3. You should see your new blog post displayed
4. Click on the blog card to view the full post

### 4. Test Individual Blog Page
- The blog card should open the full blog post in a new tab
- URL will be something like: `http://localhost:5173/blogs/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`
- The full content should display properly

## Troubleshooting the ID Error

The error you saw (`Invalid blog post ID format`) happens when:

### ‚ùå **Wrong ID Format**
- URLs like `/blogs/1` or `/blogs/2` (simple numbers)
- These are not valid MongoDB ObjectIds

### ‚úÖ **Correct ID Format** 
- URLs like `/blogs/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011` (24-character hex string)
- These are valid MongoDB ObjectIds generated automatically

### üîß **How to Fix**
1. **Don't manually type blog URLs** - always click from the homepage
2. **Create blogs through admin panel** - they get proper IDs automatically
3. **Check the debug info** - in development mode, you'll see actual IDs

## Expected Behavior

### Homepage Blog Section
- Shows "No blog posts available yet" if database is empty
- Shows up to 6 most recent posts when blogs exist
- Each card shows title, author, excerpt, read time, and date
- Cards are clickable and open individual blog pages

### Individual Blog Pages
- Full blog content display
- Author and publication info
- Share functionality
- Proper error handling for invalid IDs

### Admin Interface
- Create, edit, delete blogs
- Real-time updates to homepage
- Form validation and error handling

## Sample Blog Posts to Create

Try creating these test posts:

### Post 1: Food Guide
- **Title**: "5 Best Pizza Places in Town"
- **Author**: "Food Critic"
- **Content**: "Discover the most delicious pizza spots that will satisfy your cravings. From classic margherita to innovative toppings, these restaurants serve up perfection on every slice."

### Post 2: Tips & Tricks

## Debug Information

In development mode, the homepage will show:
- Number of blogs found
- Sample blog IDs
- This helps verify the system is working correctly

## Common Issues

### No Blogs Showing
- Check if backend is running on port 5000
- Verify MongoDB connection
- Create a blog post through admin panel

### Invalid ID Errors
- Don't manually type blog URLs
- Always navigate from homepage blog cards
- Check that blogs were created through the admin interface

### API Connection Issues
